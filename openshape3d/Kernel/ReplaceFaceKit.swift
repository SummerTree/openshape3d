//
//  Spec §4.12 Replace Face — extend or trim selected face(s) until they lie on
//  another face's surface, with Flip Alignment choosing which side to extend to.
//
//  For a planar face moving to a parallel plane, both directions are the SAME
//  operation on the same solid: the prism swept by the face's own outline
//  between the two planes. Extending fuses that prism onto the body; trimming
//  cuts it out. Working out which, and by how much, is all this kit does — the
//  boolean itself is `KernelOps`.
//
//  Non-parallel targets are refused rather than approximated: the gap between
//  the planes varies across the face, so a single prism would be wrong
//  everywhere except one line, and silently shipping that is worse than saying
//  no.
