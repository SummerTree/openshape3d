//
//  RebuildPlanner.swift
//  openshape3d
//
//  The pure core of a feature-graph rebuild: replay the graph, diff the result
//  against the live document, and produce the commands that bring the document
//  up to date — docs/OFF_MAIN_EVAL_DESIGN.md, slice 0.
//
//  Extracted from `DocumentSession.performRebuild` unchanged in behaviour so
//  that (1) the diff semantics — skip-unchanged replace, add, delete-consumed,
//  metadata preservation, upgrade edits — are pure-value unit-testable
//  (`DocumentSession` never is: it needs SwiftData), and (2) the detached
//  evaluate of off-main eval has a seam: everything here is a function of
//  values; only `perform` and the revision counter belong to the session.
//
//  Isolation: the module's default isolation is MainActor and the command
//  structs (`AddBodyCommand`, …) are un-annotated, so today this planner runs
//  on the main actor too — slice 0 changes no behaviour. Slice 1 marks those
//  pure value-op commands `nonisolated` so the planner can run detached.
