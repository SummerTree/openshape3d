//
//  Phase D (Task B1) — the parametric history ENGINE. A `FeatureGraph` is an
//  ordered list of editable `FeatureNode`s; `evaluate` replays them in order into
//  a live set of bodies + per-body `FaceTable`s, reproducing exactly the geometry
//  the live tools build (primitive → mesh, profile → extrude → boolean, planar
//  face push/pull) so that editing any step's parameter and re-evaluating
//  rebuilds everything downstream — including re-resolving a persisted `FaceRef`
//  against the freshly rebuilt geometry (the topological-naming payoff).
//
//  Everything here is `nonisolated` pure geometry, replayed off the main actor
//  and round-tripped through the SwiftData store as JSON. Model space is Double;
//  every emitted `Body` gets a FRESH `meshRevision` from `nextRevision()` so the
//  GPU cache invalidates, and reuses `node.outputBodyIDs` (never mints a new
//  `BodyID` on rebuild) so selection / transform / material survive an edit.
//
//  Tranche 1 EVALUATES `.primitive`, `.extrude`, `.boolean`, and
//  `.pushPull(.planarAxial)`. The remaining kinds are DEFINED (so the graph type
//  is total and Codable) but return `.kernelFailure` from `evaluate` rather than
//  building geometry — they are recorded/evaluated in tranche 2.
