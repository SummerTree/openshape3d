# Status & Next Steps — Handoff Notes

Last updated: 2026-07-21 (after commit `ee5baee`). This is the living handoff
document: what is DONE, how the newest subsystems work, the dev workflow, and
the prioritized next missions. Companions: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (original
phase plan), `SHAPR3D_PARITY_SPEC.md` (feature spec), `PHASE_D_DESIGN.md`
(feature-graph design).

## 1. Where the project stands

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| **A** — planes, sketch tools, revolve, transform, items, views, IO | ✅ done |
| **B** — sweep, loft, split, pattern, offset, text, project, section, display, selection, materials, symbols | ✅ done |
| **C** — 2D constraint solver (Levenberg–Marquardt), dimensions, auto-constrain, DOF coloring, sketch mirror | ✅ done |
| **D** — parametric feature graph: topo naming, all creation ops, sketch associativity, variables/expressions, pattern-as-feature, rollback, **reorder + suppress** | ✅ done (tranches 1–6) |
| **E** — edge blends (mesh-domain): chamfer/fillet, multi-edge, live preview, drag-to-size arrow | ✅ tranches 1–3 done |
| **E (B-rep)** — OpenCASCADE port for high-quality fillet/shell/offset | ❌ not started |

Also landed recently (all on `main`): context-sensitive Shapr3D-style tool
palette with flyout groups; extrude gizmo = SF Symbol `arrow.up.and.down` +
value pill; drag-reorder of History rows; bug-hunt regression tests.

**Test baseline: 464 unit tests, ~78 UI tests — all green.** Two UI tests
(`FaceFlowUITests/testTypeNegativeIntoArrowPill`,
`SweepLoftUITests/testSweepCircleAlongTwoSegmentLinePath`) are long-run flaky
(pass in isolation) — rerun individually before suspecting a regression.

## 2. Architecture of the newest subsystems (Phase E blends)

The mesh-domain chamfer/fillet the spec §4.3 blesses for prismatic edges.
Everything routes through the same three seams as the rest of the app:
`KernelOps` (geometry), `DocumentCommand` (mutation), `EditorViewModel`
(state machine).

- `openshape3d/Kernel/EdgeTopology.swift` — `SelectableEdge` (endpoints + the
  two adjacent face normals + convexity); `selectableEdges(from:)` welds
  positions and merges collinear same-face-pair creases into maximal straight
  edges; `signature(of:)` / `resolve(_:in:sizeScale:)` re-find an edge after a
  rebuild (adjacent-face-normal PAIR dominates the score).
- `openshape3d/Kernel/KernelOps.swift` — `chamferEdge` (subtract a triangular
  corner-wedge prism), `filletEdge` (subtract the corner parallelogram MINUS a
  tangent cylinder **centered on the edge** — Euclid's `extrude` is centered,
  so the cylinder must be too).
- `openshape3d/Model/FeatureRefs.swift` — `EdgeRef`/`EdgeSignature`.
- `openshape3d/Model/FeatureGraph.swift` — `FeatureKind.chamfer/.fillet`,
  `evalEdgeBlend`: resolves `EdgeRef`s against the **input** body (a blend
  destroys the edge it names), errors → History badge. JSON-Codable kinds, so
  no schema migration was needed.
- `openshape3d/Editor/EditorViewModel.swift` — blend section:
  `beginBlend/handleBlendEdgeTap/commitBlend/cancelBlend`, live `blendPreview`
  (recomputed on edge toggle + `blendValue` didSet, rendered IN PLACE of the
  source body, high-bit GPU-cache revision `(1<<62)|n`),
  `beginBlendDrag/updateBlendDrag/endBlendDrag`, `resetBlendState()` (state
  only — **never mutates `selection`**; wired into `cancelTransientPicks` and
  `sanitizeAfterHistoryChange`).
- `openshape3d/UI/ViewportView.swift` — `.pickingBlendEdges` drag branch:
  geometric screen-space arrow grab (same as face push/pull); drag delta
  projects onto the arrow's **on-screen** direction × `worldUnitsPerPoint`.
- `openshape3d/UI/EditorView.swift` — `blendBar` replaces `NumericInputBar`
  in the bottom stack while picking (never two bottom overlays — see gotchas).
- Arrow rendering is free: publishing `scene.pullArrow` during the pick makes
  `ExtrudeGizmoOverlay` draw the handle; `extrudeArrowLabel` is nil in blend
  mode so no extrude pill appears. `isValid=false` (preview ate the body)
  renders it red, and `canCommitBlend` disables Apply.

Tests: `openshape3dTests/KernelBlendTests.swift` (exact volumes),
`openshape3dTests/FeatureBlendEvalTests.swift` (parametric eval, edit-rebuild,
multi-edge additivity, error surfacing),
`openshape3dUITests/BlendUITests.swift` (4 end-to-end flows incl. drag).

### Known v1 gaps (deliberate, documented)
- Corners where 3+ blended edges meet are best-effort (sequential CSG order).
- Concave edges unsupported (material-removal only; concave needs additive fill).
- No tangent-chain auto-propagation (spec: picking 2 edges of a chain rounds
  the whole chain).
- One body per blend feature.
- Fillet cross-section is a prismatic quarter-round (true rolling-ball corners
  and G2 need the B-rep kernel).

## 3. Dev workflow essentials

- Simulator UDID: `69DB84F4-607C-46F2-9089-3E8C0770B4A9` (iPad). Ad-hoc
  screenshots: `scripts/run_sim.sh`.
- Build: `xcodebuild build -scheme openshape3d -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=69DB84F4-...'`
- Tests (always `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`):
  - unit: `-only-testing:openshape3dTests`
  - UI: `-only-testing:openshape3dUITests/<Class>[/<test>]`
- UI-test helpers in `openshape3dUITests/PullArrowTestSupport.swift`:
  `startSketchTool(app,"Rect")`, `tapPaletteTool(app, group:"Modify", id:/label:)`
  (opens the flyout only if the tool isn't already hittable), `dragPullArrow`.
  Fresh-document launch: `app.launchEnvironment["OS3D_FRESH"] = "1"`.
- Verification hooks: `SelectionInfoBar` rows (Volume/Bounds/Area/Edges…),
  History ids `HistoryRow-<name>` / `HistoryError-<name>` /
  `HistorySuppress-<name>` / `HistoryDistanceField`, Items `ItemRow-*`, error
  alert title "Something Went Wrong".

### Gotchas that will bite you
1. **SwiftData in XCTest**: any in-process `ModelContainer` with the 7-type
   `PersistedFeature` schema crashes deterministically (malloc double-free).
   Never unit-test `DocumentSession`; use pure `DesignDocument` values +
   `FeatureGraph.evaluate` (see `FeatureGraphEvalTests`) and UI tests.
2. **a11y containers**: an `.accessibilityIdentifier` on a container HStack
   collapses it into ONE element and hides every child control from XCUITest.
   Ids go on leaf buttons/fields only.
3. **Bottom overlays**: `EditorView` has a single bottom `.overlay` VStack
   (info strip + input bar). Add bars INSIDE it (conditionally), never as a
   second `.overlay(alignment: .bottom)` — they cover each other.
4. **SourceKit noise**: per-file diagnostics ("Cannot find type …", "No such
   module XCTest") are cross-file/-target indexing noise. `xcodebuild` is the
   authority.
5. **GPU mesh cache** keys on `(BodyID, meshRevision)` — any transient preview
   body must bump a revision (use a high-bit counter to avoid colliding with
   document revisions).
6. **`MainActor` default isolation** (`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION`):
   kernel/graph types must be explicitly `nonisolated` (nested enums too).
7. **Selection mutation**: `deleteSelection` deletes whatever is in
   `selection` — internal cleanup paths must never write to `selection`
   (that's why `resetBlendState` exists apart from `cancelBlend`).
8. **Isolated-deinit double-free**: with `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION =
   MainActor`, an implicitly-`@MainActor` `@Observable` class gets a
   MainActor-*isolated* `deinit` (SE-0371). Deallocating one routes through
   `swift_task_deinitOnExecutorImpl`, which double-frees on the current
   toolchain (Xcode 26.2 / Swift 6.2) — deterministic malloc crash whenever a
   test lets such an instance go out of scope (bit `AppSettings`). Fix: give
   the class an explicit `nonisolated deinit {}` (no teardown work to isolate).

## 4. Next missions (prioritized)

### E4 — Shell (recommended next; spec §4.4)
Hollow a solid to a uniform wall by removing selected face(s); whole-body mode
cores it hollow. The spec blesses a prismatic mesh approximation:
- Face-removal mode: reuse the face-selection context
  (`FaceTopology.planarFace` outline/holes) → inset the outline by thickness
  (`SketchOffset` does 2D offset already) → extrude the inset profile into the
  body and subtract (`KernelOps` has all the pieces).
- Whole-body mode: scale/offset a copy inward and subtract (exact for convex
  prisms; document the gap for concave).
- Parametric: `FeatureKind.shell(body: BodyRef, face: FaceRef?, thickness:
  Expr)`; eval mirrors `evalPushPull` (resolve FaceRef → kernel op → relabel).
- Live red/blue validity on the thickness drag mirrors the blend arrow's
  `isValid` wiring exactly.

### E5 — Blend polish
- **Tangent-chain propagation**: group `SelectableEdge`s whose endpoints touch
  and whose directions are near-parallel at the join; a tap selects the chain.
- **Concave edges**: additive corner fill (union the wedge instead of
  subtracting) — `isConvex` already classifies.
- **History edge re-pick**: "edit edges of an existing blend feature" (spec:
  additive edit-mode selection) — needs a History row action that re-enters
  `.pickingBlendEdges` seeded from the node's EdgeRefs.

### F — OpenCASCADE B-rep port (the big one)
Behind the existing `KernelOps` facade (see `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase E
section for scope): OCCT compiled for iOS, solids become B-rep, Euclid stays
the render/preview path. Unlocks true fillets (tangent chains, rolling-ball
corners, G2), robust booleans, shell/offset-face quality. Start with a spike:
build OCCT.xcframework, round-trip one box through
`BRepPrimAPI_MakeBox` → mesh → `RenderMesh`.
**Concrete ordered scope + spike/kill-criteria: `docs/OCCT_BREP_PORT_DESIGN.md`.**
This is what fixes extruded circles rendering as 48-gon prisms (no mesh-side fix
exists — the representation itself must become analytic).
**M0 spike + M1 wiring DONE (2026-07-22):** OCCT 7.8.1 cross-built for iOS
(`scripts/build_occt_ios.sh` → `ThirdParty/OCCT.xcframework`, gitignored,
modeling-only ~74 MB/arch). OCCT is now **linked into the app** and callable
from Swift via `OCCTKernel` (Obj-C++ `OCCTBridge` behind a dedicated bridging
header — NOT `ShaderTypes.h`, which Metal shares). `openshape3dTests/
OCCTKernelTests` proves it in-suite (extruded circle = 1 analytic cylinder);
**full suite 499 green**. STEP/IGES deferred (build-flag flip; ~doubles the lib).
**A circle extrude now renders as a TRUE smooth cylinder** (OCCT analytic
tessellation + surface normals), visually confirmed on-device — behind
`OCCTKernel.renderCircleExtrudesWithOCCT`, Euclid still owns CSG. Seed a demo
with `SIMCTL_CHILD_OS3D_FRESH=1 SIMCTL_CHILD_OS3D_DEBUG_SEED_CYLINDER=1`.
**OCCT is now the source of truth for circle extrude + boolean:** `Body.brep`
(`BRepHandle`) carries the analytic solid; `evalBoolean` composes breps
(`BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse/Cut/Common`) and renders smooth — so a cylinder MINUS a
cylinder stays round (verified on-device: `SIMCTL_CHILD_OS3D_DEBUG_SEED_BOOLEAN=1`).
Euclid still computes CSG → suite 500 green. Next: general (polygonal/arc)
profiles as B-rep source, analytic holes, extrude-into-target boolean, B-rep
persistence, then fillet/shell on B-rep. Repro: `scripts/run_occt_spike.sh`.

### Deferred backlog (from Phase D)
- Transform-as-a-feature — **design blocker documented** in
  `PHASE_D_DESIGN.md` / memory: eval emits world-space+identity meshes while
  live tools store localized-mesh+pivot; needs an eval-representation rework
  (dedicated tranche).
- Sketch patterns, EdgeRef-based dimensioning, MaterialTagNaming (needs OS3D
  v2 blob format), linked copies, PrimitiveSpec-dim variables, full unit
  conversion.

## 5. Conventions for the next session

- One tranche = backend (pure, unit-tested) → UI → UI test → full-suite gate →
  commit. Keep commits per tranche with detailed messages (see `git log`).
- New geometry ops: `nonisolated` statics on `KernelOps`, end in
  `.makeWatertight()`, unit-test exact volumes on a cube first.
- New feature kinds: add the case + eval + arms in `HistoryPanelView.iconName`,
  `distanceValue`, `EditorViewModel.kindLabel`, `kind(_:replacingExpr:)` —
  the compiler's exhaustive-switch errors will walk you through them.
- Update this file at the end of each mission.
